- You can find the documentation here: [Doku](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) 
- The slides are navigatable with the arrows on your keyboard
- Google Chrome offers the best user experience
- "F" jumps to fullscreen mode, exit with ESC
- "O" shows an overview of all slides, exit with ESC
- CTRL + P offers a view which is perfect for printing. You can also print those as pdfs, but you need to have the dev server running locally to use this feature
